Input filename: test_rrbs_2.fastq
Trimming mode: paired-end
Trim Galore version: 0.6.10
Cutadapt version: 2.6
Python version: could not detect
Number of cores used for trimming: 8
Quality Phred score cutoff: 20
Quality encoding type selected: ASCII+33
Using Illumina adapter for trimming (count: 3931). Second best hit was smallRNA (count: 0)
Adapter sequence: 'AGATCGGAAGAGC' (Illumina TruSeq, Sanger iPCR; auto-detected)
Maximum trimming error rate: 0.1 (default)
Minimum required adapter overlap (stringency): 1 bp
Minimum required sequence length for both reads before a sequence pair gets removed: 20 bp
File was specified to be an MspI-digested RRBS sample. Read 1 sequences with adapter contamination will be trimmed a further 2 bp from their 3' end, and Read 2 sequences will be trimmed by 2 bp from their 5' end to remove potential methylation-biased bases from the end-repair reaction
All Read 1 sequences will be trimmed by 4 bp from their 5' end to avoid poor qualities or biases
All Read 2 sequences will be trimmed by 4 bp from their 5' end to avoid poor qualities or biases (e.g. M-bias for BS-Seq applications)
All Read 1 sequences will be trimmed by 1 bp from their 3' end to avoid poor qualities or biases
All Read 2 sequences will be trimmed by 1 bp from their 3' end to avoid poor qualities or biases

RUN STATISTICS FOR INPUT FILE: test_rrbs_2.fastq
=============================================
10000 sequences processed in total
Sequences were truncated to a varying degree because of deteriorating qualities (Phred score quality cutoff: 20):	2543 (25.4%)
RRBS reads trimmed by additional 2 bp when adapter contamination was detected:	0 (0.0%)

Total number of sequences analysed for the sequence pair length validation: 10000

Number of sequence pairs removed because at least one read was shorter than the length cutoff (20 bp): 1403 (14.03%)
