Bismark report for: ./test_rrbs_1_val_1.fq and ./test_rrbs_2_val_2.fq (version: v0.24.2)
Bismark was run with Bowtie 2 against the bisulfite genome of /home/ubuntu/sra_data/reference_genome/ with the specified options: -q --score-min L,-0.6,-0.6 --ignore-quals --no-mixed --no-discordant --dovetail --maxins 500
Option '--non_directional' specified: alignments to all strands were being performed (OT, OB, CTOT, CTOB)

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequence pairs analysed in total:	8597
Number of paired-end alignments with a unique best hit:	2913
Mapping efficiency:	33.9% 
Sequence pairs with no alignments under any condition:	4594
Sequence pairs did not map uniquely:	1090
Sequence pairs which were discarded because genomic sequence could not be extracted:	0

Number of sequence pairs with unique best (first) alignment came from the bowtie output:
CT/GA/CT:	885	((converted) top strand)
GA/CT/CT:	209	(complementary to (converted) top strand)
GA/CT/GA:	186	(complementary to (converted) bottom strand)
CT/GA/GA:	1633	((converted) bottom strand)
